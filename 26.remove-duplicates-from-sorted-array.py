# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,2]'
#
# Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each
# element appear only once and return the new length.
# 
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying
# the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Given nums = [1,1,2],
# 
# Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums
# being 1 and 2 respectively.
# 
# It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
# 
# Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums
# being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
# 
# It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
# 
# 
# Clarification:
# 
# Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
# 
# Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification
# to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
# 
# Internally you can think of this:
# 
# 
# // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
# int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
# 
# // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
# // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len
# elements.
# for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
# print(nums[i]);
# }
#

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        unique_count = 0
        if not nums:
            return unique_count #判断是否是空数列
        current_num = None
        current_idx = -1        #建立一个新的对比起点
        for x in nums:
            if x != current_num:
                new_idx = current_idx + 1
                nums[new_idx] = x
                current_num = x             #不重复的数字向前移动代替重复数字的位置
                current_idx = new_idx
                unique_count += 1
        nums = nums[0:unique_count]
        return unique_count
